        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="./Assets//images/JenniferMullin.JPG" alt="jen" width="200" height="190" style="float: left" />
        <p> Born and raised in Rhode Island, I made the move to Denver, Colorado in July of 2019.
            Moving to Denver has been one of the best life decisions to date! It has allowed me to gain
            a new found independence and, along with that, a desire to explore a new career in the field of programming.
            Having worked for technology companies for the past 8 years in either an account management or business development
            capacity, I'm looking forward to exploring the world of coding and all of the opportunities that come with it!
        </p>
        <p> When not learning to code, I enjoy exploring all that the awesome city of Denver/beautiful state of Colorado has to offer - 
            hiking, kayaking, experiencing the food/beer scene and making new friends!
